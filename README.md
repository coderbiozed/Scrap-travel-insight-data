# Web Scraping Project Overview
## Objective
The goal of this project is to extract geographical demand data from a web application using Python and Selenium.

## Technologies Used
 - Selenium
 - BeautifulSoup
 - Python
 

## Project Structure
- `scraping.py`: Main script for web scraping.
- `geographic_demand_data.csv`: CSV file to store extracted data.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coderbiozed/Scrap-travel-insight-data.git
   ```
    ```bash 
    cd scraping
    ```
## Run the script:

```bash
python scraping.py
```
## Configuration
The script can be configured by modifying variables like **start_index and end_index**  in scraping.py
Ensure the correct ðŸ‘‰ XPath and ðŸ‘‰ CSS Selector values for web elements.


### Setting Up Virtual Environment
#### mathematica
1. Install `virtualenv` if not already installed:
2. 
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
Create a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv venv
```


#### Activate the virtual environment:

1. On Windows:
```bash
\venv\Scripts\activate
```
2. On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Install dependencies from requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
ðŸ‘‰ Now, your virtual environment is set up, and you can run the web scraping script within this environment. Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:

```bash
deactivate
```
## Workflow
  1. Open a webpage using Selenium.
  2. Interact with the page by clicking buttons and dropdowns.
  3. Extract data from the resulting page using BeautifulSoup.
  4. Store the extracted data in a CSV file.
  5. Automate the process for multiple iterations using a loop.
  
## Code Breakdown
### Section 1: Web Interaction
 1. Locate and click on specific elements on the webpage using XPaths and CSS Selectors.
 2. Utilize Selenium's ActionChains to perform a click at the middle of the page.
 3. Scroll to and click on dropdown options dynamically based on a range of indices.
### Section 2: Data Extraction
 1. Find and click on a specific tab.
 2. Extract HTML content from a dynamically loaded section of the page.
 3. Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
 4. Iterate through list items and extract city-data.
### Section 3: CSV File Handling
 1. Write extracted data to a CSV file.
 2. Optionally, append data to an existing CSV file without overwriting.
## Main Points
 - Web Automation: Selenium is used for web automation, enabling interaction with dynamic web elements and data extraction.
 - Data Extraction: BeautifulSoup is employed to parse HTML content and extract relevant data, showcasing the power of web scraping.
 - Dynamic Interaction: The project demonstrates handling dynamic elements such as dropdowns and loading content, making it adaptable to changes in the web application.
 - Data Persistence: Extracted data is stored in a CSV file, providing a structured and accessible format for further analysis.
## Interesting Points
 - Automation Efficiency: The automation of repetitive tasks is a key efficiency gain, especially when dealing with a large dataset or frequent updates.
 - Adaptability: The project is designed to handle dynamic web pages, ensuring it remains effective even if the web application changes.
 - Integration Potential: The extracted data in CSV format allows for easy integration with other tools and platforms for additional analysis.
## Conclusion
This web scraping project showcases the use of Selenium and BeautifulSoup to automate data extraction from a dynamic web application. It highlights the efficiency, adaptability, and integration potential of web scraping for data analysis.
